Serious code:
* [Deep Dreams](https://github.com/JasonD94/DeepDreams) - some Python I wrote to download images off of the Deep Dream Generator website
* [Loan Repayment](https://github.com/JasonD94/Loan-Repayment) - a Vue.js app I made to calculate student loan interest a while back
* [LinkedIn Data Formatter](https://github.com/JasonD94/LinkedIn-Data-Formatter) - does some data analysis on exported LinkedIn data, such as the "messages.csv" file you get from the LinkedIn Data Privacy Export.
* [Strava Data Formatter](https://github.com/JasonD94/Strava-Data-Formatter) - similar idea to the LinkedIn one, but analyzing exported data from Strava. Strava provides an "activities.csv" file which contains some interesting data about activities you upload/record with Strava. I wanted to know how many miles a week I bike, so I wrote a bit of Python with Pandas to calculate that. This is a WIP - I'll be adding more analyze scripts and reworking the existing one to take user input so I can calculate my running average over an arbitrary number of weeks instead of hardcoding it to an 8 week period.

Fun code:
* [Spotify](https://github.com/JasonD94/Spotify) - some of my more popular Spotify playlists, displayed using the Spotify widgets
* [Generate some sPonGeBoB tExT](https://downing.io/gEnErAtEsPoNgEbObTeXt/) - mOsTlY fOr GiGgLeS
* [Morty roll](https://downing.io/Mortyroll/) and [Sandroll](https://downing.io/Sandroll/) - just some funny YouTube videos
